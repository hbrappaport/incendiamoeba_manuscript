Pre-processing DIC images for analysis performed in FIJI with “DIC_FFT_FOV_macro.ijm”. Edge detection/segmentation and x,y position along with shape metrics and frame number assignment performed using “analyzeparticles_fitellipse.ijm" and data exported as csv. Particle tracking from exported csvs performed in R with KtrackedShape.R. Futher analysis such as: directional change (DirectionalChange.R), velocity (Velocity.R; Velocity_by_Shape.R) and mean squared displacement (MSD.R) performed in R. Data visualized with ggplot2.
